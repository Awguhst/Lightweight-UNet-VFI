# Video Frame Interpolation with Lightweight U-Net

## What is Video Frame Interpolation?

Video frame interpolation is a technique that generates new **intermediate frames** between two existing consecutive frames in a video. This creates the illusion of smoother motion and effectively increases the frame rate (e.g., from 30 FPS to 60 FPS) without changing the playback speed.

Why is it useful?
- Turns choppy low-FPS videos into buttery-smooth high-FPS ones
- Enables convincing slow-motion from normal-speed footage
- Improves visual quality for old videos, games, or compressed content

Traditional methods (like simple blending) often produce ghosting or blurry artifacts. Modern deep learning approaches, like this U-Net model, learn complex motion patterns to synthesize realistic in-between frames with sharp details and accurate object movement.

## Project Overview
This is a simple U-Net model trained on the Vimeo-90K dataset. It takes two consecutive frames as input and predicts a high-quality middle frame, enabling smooth video frame rate upsampling while preserving motion continuity and minimizing visual artifacts.

Upload any video, interpolate frames, and download the smoother version with original audio preserved.

## Side-by-Side Video Comparison
Here's a simple side-by-side comparison of an original low-FPS clip (left) next to the interpolated smoother version (right), demonstrating the dramatic improvement in motion fluidity:
